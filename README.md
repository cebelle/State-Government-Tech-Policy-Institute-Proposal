# State Government Tech Policy Institute (SGTPI) Proposal
A four-year program proposal to equip state officials with blockchain expertise through training, resources, and an updated legislative repository, fostering coherence in state-level regulation and addressing the need for government-specific guidance.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The regulatory landscape for blockchain and cryptocurrency in the United States is evolving rapidly, yet inconsistently across states. The result is fragmented and sometimes contradictory legal frameworks. This is a working draft proposal for a State Government Tech Policy Institute at a university. The proposal is a two-year proof of concept program to create a comprehensive, trusted resource for state officials. 

This program aims to unify and enhance state-level understanding of blockchain-related legislation, improve the accessibility of relevant legal definitions, and offer training workshops tailored to the unique challenges faced by policymakers. With activities that include government training, practical use-case materials, and continuously updated research, this program will provide state officials with actionable knowledge and inform great knowledge and expertise amongst policymakers. The funding will support faculty expertise, a dedicated program manager, essential operations, and resources to create a secure digital platform accessible to officials nationwide. By filling a critical gap in blockchain legislative resources, this program aligns with the Centerâ€™s mission to advance the social good by pioneering educational and legal solutions for emerging technologies.

This is a work in progress and designed to be updated.
